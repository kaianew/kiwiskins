This is the final project for Persuasive Design. We made a visual novel where you try to uncover the true identity of your online friend. The main mechanics and themes attempt to 1) teach the player about how to manage their own energy levels (spoon theory) and 2) reduce bias against people with chronic, invisible illnesses.
